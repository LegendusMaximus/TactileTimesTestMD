## Introduction


Welcome to the homepage of the Tactile Times website! You can find out about all the latest news for young braillists here, as well as subscribe, contribute and get in touch with us.
We have published three issues so far aiming to keep young braillists throughout the UK and beyond updated with articles about fun things to do, technology, sport, events and much more. During lockdown, we also sent out weekly events updates to give our subscribers one place they could go to for a list of the events happening each week. We also updated the website often with the latest events information. To view what our homepage was like in lockdown, just click [here](/archive-index.html)!

We are run by young braillists and our content is aimed at young braillists. We realised there were no newspapers directly aimed at young braillists and this is why we set up the Tactile Times.
To find out more About us check out our [About us](/about.md) page. Anyone can subscribe to the newspaper and it is completely free to subscribe to both the electronic and hard copy braille versions.
## Navigation
This website has been designed to be fully accessible to anyone, including those using a screen reader. It has lots of headings to help you navigate and to group things into sections to make them easier to find. If you would like to find the full menu, just navigate to the menu heading.
## Audio logo
We have an audio logo available to play from the button below. Have some fun playing with it!
